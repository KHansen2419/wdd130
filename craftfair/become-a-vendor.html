                <h4> What we require</h4>
                <p> We will require you to give a full list of where you recieve your items and materials for your handmade projects. You will need to tell us the type of homemade good you are wanting to sell, pictures will help.
                    You make your own setup, meaning we will provide the space but you will need to provide everything else to make your display. Our booth rent is based on how much you sell. If you sell over $150 in product then 
                    your booth rent will be 4% of your sales. If you make less than $150 we will require a flat rate of $10.

                    If you are selling food, we will need the nutritional value and index of all of your food items, as well as a list of ingredients. 
                </p>
