    <h2>Katie Hansen</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone I am Katie Hansen. 
        I have been married to Kelland Hansen for 8 years now. We have three beautiful children. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a small business in the crafting community where I produce and sell different patterns for people to follow.
        I have created a website from my business previously, which has garnered my interest in web and software development.

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for ten years now. I just recently passed the anniversary of my baptism at the end of March.
